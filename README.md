# React 19 Task Management Board

A modern task management application built with React 19, demonstrating the latest features and best practices.

## Features

### 1. Task Board Management
- Create and manage multiple lists
- Add tasks to lists
- Drag and drop tasks between lists
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Persistent storage using localStorage

### 2. Real-time UI Feedback
- Loading states during async operations
- Optimistic updates for immediate user feedback
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 3. Modern UI Components
- Responsive layout with styled-components
- Ant Design integration for UI components
- Custom styled cards and containers
- Drag and drop interface
- Loading spinners and progress indicators

## React 19 Features Implemented

### 1. `useOptimistic`
Used for optimistic updates in multiple places:
- Adding new tasks (List.tsx)
- Adding new lists (Board.tsx)
- Moving tasks between lists
- Updating task counts

Example:
```typescript
const [optimisticTasks, addOptimisticTask] = useOptimistic(
  list.tasks,
  (currentTasks: TaskType[], newTask: TaskType) => [...currentTasks, newTask]
);
```

### 2. `useActionState`
Implemented for form handling and async operations:
- Task creation form
- List creation form
- Error state management
- Loading state management

Example:
```typescript
const [formState, submitAction] = useActionState<
  { error: string | null },
  { title: string }
>(async (_prevState, formData) => {
  // ... async logic
});
```

### 3. `useTransition`
Used for managing pending states during:
- Task addition
- List creation
- Task movement between lists

Example:
```typescript
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

startTransition(() => {
  submitAction({ title: newTaskTitle });
});
```

### 4. Async Actions
Proper handling of async operations with simulated API delays:
- Task creation (1000ms delay)
- List creation (1000ms delay)
- Optimistic updates during async operations

## Architecture Highlights

### 1. Type Safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Strict type checking
- Interface definitions for all components

### 2. Component Structure
- Modular component design
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable styled components

### 3. State Management
- React 19's built-in state management
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Local storage persistence

### 4. Error Handling
- Form validation
- Async operation error handling
- User feedback for all operations

## Best Practices

1. **React 19 Patterns**
   - Use of function components
   - Proper handling of transitions
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Type-safe props and state

2. **Performance**
   - Optimistic updates for perceived performance
   - Proper use of useTransition for non-blocking updates
   - Efficient re-renders

3. **User Experience**
   - Loading states
   - Error feedback
   - Smooth animations
   - Responsive design
